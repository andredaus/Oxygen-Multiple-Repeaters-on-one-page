# Oxygen-Multiple-Repeaters-on-one-page

This is a reminder mainly for myself ;-) to add multiple Repeaters on one page within Oxygen Builder

I used it for a page template that shows the latest post as a big one on top, certain category posts below in medium and the rest in small. hence, i have 3 functions that calculate the necessary queries for each repeater. I added them in a codeblock.
